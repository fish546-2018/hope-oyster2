# Project Description:
<<<<<<< HEAD
# For my project I will be using pre-existing data to practice analyses such as looking at diversity and population structure

# Repository Structure:
# My repository has three directories: data, analyses, and scripts. I only have empty text files in them right now but will add files as I create them.

# Projected Timeline:
# In weeks 4 and 5 I plan to find, download, and organize my data. I will then begin to analyze the data. I will first start by practicing running blast. I will also research other tests to run to understand population structure.

**For my project I am using pre-existing oyster data to learn how to download data, run fastqc, align and call SNPs so that I will be able to run these analyses on my own in the future**

# Repository Structure:

# Data: the .fq data files for two paired-end samples: sample1A, sample1B, sample2A, sample2B
# Analyses: fastqc results in html format for each sample (4), oyster reference genome in ebwt format as index for bowtie
# Scripts: jupyter notebook scripts for downloading the data using curl, running fastQC, and the start for a script to run botwie

# Projected Timeline:

I am currently in the process of using Bowtie to align the paired end samples to an index containing a reference oyster genome
